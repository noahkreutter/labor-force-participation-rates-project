# labor-force-participation-rates-project
A short research project I did for the Penn Wharton Budget Model investigating labor force participation rates by age from 1995 to 2015. 
Data for the project is contained in the attached .csv file. All work was completed in the attached Jupyter notebook. 
Work was originally done in Stata. 

I recommend downloading the notebook and viewing it through Jupyter notebooks, as some of the formatting is displayed incorrectly when 
viewed through GitHub.
